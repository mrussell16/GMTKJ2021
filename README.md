# GMTKJ 2021

Godot Project  for the GMTKJ 2021.

Theme is "Joined Together".

For this I am developing a 2D platformer where the player can travel between two connected dimensions (light and dark).

Key ideas:

* Limited time can be spent in the dark dimension
* Collect light seeds to stay in the dark dimension longer
* Some platforms are only present in light/dark versions
* Enemies attack and reduce time
* Moving/shooting could reduce time

# ToDo

* Sat Afternoon
    * Add collectible light seeds
        * New level to introduce this
    * Add enemies to get light seeds
        * Jump on enemies to kill them
    * Spike traps
    * Win Screen - thanks for playing
* Sat Evening
    * Movable objects
        * Move in light dimension will move in the dark dimension
        * Move in dark dimension will not move in light dimension
* Sun Morn
    * Better player sprite + animation (maybe get online)
    * Portal Sounds
    * Music
* Sun Afternoon
    * Itch page
    * Initial Release
    * More Levels - if there is time
