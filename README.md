# GMTKJ 2021

Godot Project  for the GMTKJ 2021.

Theme is "Joined Together".

For this I am developing a 2D platformer where the player can travel between two connected dimensions (light and dark).

Key ideas:

* Limited time can be spent in the dark dimension
* Collect light seeds to stay in the dark dimension longer
* Some platforms are only present in light/dark versions
* Enemies attack and reduce time
* Moving/shooting could reduce time

# ToDo

* Countdown for dark dimension
    * Reset player to light dimension portal when out of time
* Add enemies to get light seeds
* Better player sprite
* More Levels
* Portal Sounds
* Music
* Release
